# Blocitoff: A self-destructing to-do list

Blocitoff lets users create their own to-do lists. Each to-do item can be created with a priority level and can be marked as completed when that task is finished. After seven days, if a to-do item is not completed, Blocitoff will automatically expire the item.

Blocitoff was created as a mentor-led project with the code school [Bloc](http://bloc.io) in order to practice front-end development skills especially within the library of React.js.

Additionally, the app was initially created with [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app) and utilizes [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com) for its database.
